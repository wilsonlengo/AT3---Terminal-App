# **Software Development Plan**



### **_Statement of Purpose_**

#### The purpose of this terminal application is for the user to build their custom "sub" from Subway via user input and ingredients can be referenced via a dictionary. Essentially, this is replicating a typically Subway store visit in real time, except this interaction is simulated with my terminal application.

### **_Application features_**

#### 
* Welcome feature
* Menu 
* Sub Builder
* Price output/ Receipt Generator
* Delivery


### **_Outline_**
#### The intended user experience is that a menu will pop up with each step in building the sub, and the user will choose their ingredients with user input, but can only choose the ingredients available to them. Once their sub has been built, the application will ask if the user would want any additions from the side menu such as a drink or cookies. Next, the total price is calculated and a receipt is printed on the screen. After that, the user would be prompted to if they want their order delivered or not. If they want their order delivered, they would they would be prompted to type in their information and this information will be stored in a database.
