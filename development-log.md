# Status update #1 - 12/7/21 - Monday
I have began the software development plan and touched base on the implementation plan. I have also began the coding part of my terminal application. I have created a dictionary of all ingredients that is needed to form a sandwich. This dictionary contains sub dictionaries for each step of creating the sandwich. The challenges I've faced was accessing the dictionary for the user input part when creating my functions, but I have ultimately fixed the problem because all I needed to do was add quotation marks for my keys and my sub-dictionaries, a quick easy fix. What I should've done was complete my implementation plan first before beginning the coding so that this problem couldn't have occured.

# Status update #2 - 16/7/21 - Friday
I have completed all essential features in my application including the welcome feature, menu/submenu, receipt generator, and delivery output. I have also polished the essential documents such as the software development plan and the implementation plan, as well as the control flow diagram. Now I'm going to complete my bash script and also my help document. The challenges I've faced was implementing a custom sub creation, as it was too complex for me. Ultimately, I've scrapped the custom sub creation and only included ordering from the main menu or side menu (sub menu). Hopefully in the future I can come back to this application to implement the custom sub creation feature when I've learned and practised more with python!
