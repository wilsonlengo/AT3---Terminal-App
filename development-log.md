# Status update #1 - 12/7/12 - Monday
I have began the software development plan and touched base on the implementation plan. I have also began the coding part of my terminal application. I have created a dictionary of all ingredients that is needed to form a sandwich. This dictionary contains sub dictionaries for each step of creating the sandwich. The challenges I've faced was accessing the dictionary for the user input part when creating my functions, but I have ultimately fixed the problem because all I needed to do was add quotation marks for my keys and my sub-dictionaries, a quick easy fix. What I should've done was complete my implementation plan first before beginning the coding so that this problem couldn't have occured.
